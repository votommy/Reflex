# Reflex
Reflex - my first "reaction".  
Learning the fundamentals of ***React.js*** to keep up with the industry.  

# Open Movie Database (OMDb)
**Website**: [Open Movie Database](https://votommy.github.io/Reflex/)  
Search any movie title to receive a list of movies from a database.  
The OMDb API is limited to 1000 queries per day. If at any point, the search results don't come through, that might be the reason.

## Developer Guide
After making any changes to the code, do `npm run deploy` to update it on GitHub pages.
