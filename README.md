# Reflex
My first React.js project. Learning the fundamentals to keep up with the industry.  

## Open Movie Database (OMBd)
**Website**: [Open Movie Database](https://votommy.github.io/Reflex/)  
Search any movie title to return a list of movies in which the titles contain the search value.  
The OMBd API is limited to 1000 queries per day. If at any point, the search results don't come through, that might be the reason.

Developed with the help of a React crash course
